	<h1>So you want to buy a home. Here are some quick tips.</h1>

	<p id="paragraph"> <h2>Real Estate is always changing for many reasons.</h2>
		<p id="codeup">Real estate is never static because money, land and people are constantly moving. Even the condition of a piece of land or the improvements on it, like homes, barns or a mall, are always changing over time. Here are some things to consider when purchasing a home:</p>

		<h5 class="codeup"> (Not in any order of priority)</h5>
		<ul> 
			<li class="think">Cash available for the purchase.
			</li>
			<li class="think">Personal assets in terms of skills for property maintenance and improvement vs. the need to hire contractors to do jobs.
			</li>
			<li class="think">Lifestyle and social preferences.
			</li>
		</ul>

		These are some of the steps for purchasing a home efficiently:<br>
		<h5> (In order of priority)</h5>
		<li id="list"> 
			<li class="steps">Interview lenders. Follow their instructions for receiving any gifts from family. Get mortgage preapproval and your price range.
			</li>
			<li class="steps">Interview reputable real estate agents for representation and sign a buyer representation agreement.
			</li>
			<li class="steps" id="codeup">Go shopping with a written list of your "must have" and "want to have" features. 
			</li>
